# Unnamed shooter game

This is my little project to test out my coding skills. I plan for it to be easily moddable and i'll make some wiki pages then.

For now, feel free to check out and well..

# Compile this thing

I have included scripts + the .vscode folder config whatever its called to compile it. (windows only because uhhh)

If you dont use vscode, hopefully the ``windows-compile.bat`` or ``linux-compile.sh`` file work for you.
also for linux look at [this](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux).
